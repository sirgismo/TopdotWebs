    "This modern house boasts a minimalist design and is situated on a compact 20' by 80' corner lot in the bustling city of Toronto. With three bedrooms, the house features two bedrooms on the second floor that share a washroom in between. The third floor is dedicated to the master bedroom, which boasts a unique and stylish design with all walls and ceilings tilted.",
    "The open concept layout is enhanced by a dual system door/skylight from Denmark, which complements the building's angles and provides access to a private balcony on the third floor. An additional balcony is located on the second and half floor and is accessible via a modern wood staircase with a mono stringer design in the middle of the house. The staircase divides the building in half and offers picturesque views and an open feel throughout the house. The basement is a perfect home office space with a cozy room and separate washroom, ideal for working from home.",
    "Each room in the house has its own unique features that blend seamlessly to form a sleek and minimalistic design, finished with cedar and stucco. The house is illuminated with natural light from three sides, and benefits from natural ventilation via the staircase and skylights on top of them, providing a cozy and healthy living environment. With a combination of modern design, intelligent use of space, and ample natural light and ventilation, this house stands out as a true gem in the heart of the city."
