    "Nestled in South Etobicoke, on a quiet dead-end street near a park, the Brawley Residence transforms a modest bungalow into a refined three-story retreat, balancing minimalism with warmth. This major renovation breathes new life into the home, incorporating a secondary suite in the basement, seamlessly connected to the main residence.",
    "At its heart, a central void invites sunlight deep into the interiors, creating a poetic interplay of light and shadow while enhancing natural ventilation. The design fosters a serene, inward-looking experience, anchored by a cozy backyard and an expansive rooftop patio, offering a tranquil escape with sunset views, a BBQ area, and a sink\u2014perfect for intimate gatherings.",
    "The second floor\u2019s layout prioritizes privacy and fluidity, with two master suites at the rear and two front-facing bedrooms sharing a dual-interconnected bathroom.",
    "Through a play of light, materiality, and movement, the Brawley Residence becomes more than a home\u2014it is a living canvas, capturing the essence of time and space in an elegant, understated form"
