The initiative seeks to expand housing choices by allowing for the construction of various \"missing middle\" housing types, including <a href=\"laneway-and-garden-suites-in-toronto.html\" target=\"_blank\">laneway/garden suites</a>, duplexes, fourplexes and low-rise walk-up apartments. While these housing options exist in certain areas of Toronto, their construction is currently limited. This initiative is part of the City's broader efforts to enhance housing diversity, accessibility, and equity, contributing to a more sustainable and inclusive city.",

In Toronto, multiplexes are defined as residential buildings that consist of multiple self-contained dwelling units within a single structure. In another word, multiplexes are defined as a low-rise form of housing with two, three, or four units in a single building. These units can be independent apartments or suites, typically with separate entrances and utilities, providing housing options for multiple households within the same building. Multiplexes in Toronto can vary in size, design, and configuration, ranging from converted single-family homes to purpose-built structures specifically designed to accommodate multiple units. They offer an alternative to traditional single-detached homes and contribute to the diversity of housing options available in the city.",
