An architect can also help to address any concerns or objections from the community and provide valuable insights into the design and functionality of the proposed development. Overall, the Committee of Adjustment plays a critical role in the development process in Toronto, and having an experienced architect on board can help property owners to navigate the process successfully and achieve their development goals while contributing to the overall well-being and growth of the city.",
