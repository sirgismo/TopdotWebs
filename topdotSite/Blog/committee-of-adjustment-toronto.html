                                      <p>The Committee of Adjustment is a quasi-judicial body that is responsible for making decisions on applications related to land use and development in the City of Toronto. The Committee is made up of citizen members appointed by City Council and operates independently of the City administration. The Committee is tasked with making decisions on applications for minor variances to zoning by-laws, land severances, and consents.</p>

                                      <p>A Committee of Adjustment approval is required when a proposed building or renovation does not meet the zoning by-law requirements. For example, if the proposed building height, setback, or lot coverage does not comply with the zoning by-law, a minor variance application would need to be submitted to the Committee of Adjustment for approval. In addition, if you are looking to sever your land, create a new lot or change the boundaries of an existing lot, a consent application would need to be submitted for approval.</p>

										  <p>If you are a property owner or developer who wants to apply for a minor variance or severance, you will need to follow a specific process.</p>
										  <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pre-Application Consultation - Before submitting an application to the Committee of Adjustment, it is recommended that you have a pre-application consultation with City staff. This will help you to better understand the requirements of the Zoning By-law and the Official Plan, and ensure that your application meets the necessary tests.</p>
										  <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Submit an Application - Once you have completed your pre-application consultation, you can submit your application to the Committee of Adjustment. Your application must include a completed application form, a detailed site plan, and other supporting documentation.</p>

                                          <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Public Notice - Once your application has been received, the City will provide public notice of the proposed development. This may include posting a notice on the property, sending notices to adjacent property owners, and publishing the notice in a local newspaper.</p>

                                          <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Committee Hearing - The Committee of Adjustment will hold a public hearing to consider your application. At the hearing, you will have the opportunity to present your case and answer any questions from the Committee and members of the public.</p>

                                          <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Committee Decision - After considering your application and hearing from all parties, the Committee of Adjustment will make a decision on your application. This decision can be appealed to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT).</p>
                                          <p>If you are interested in participating in the Committee of Adjustment process, there are a few ways you can do so:</p>
                                          <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Attend the public hearing:</strong> The public is welcome to attend Committee of Adjustment hearings and observe the proceedings.</p>
                                          <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Submit comments:</strong> You can submit written comments to the Committee of Adjustment before the hearing. Your comments will be considered by the Committee when making their decision.</p>
										  <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Speak at the hearing:</strong> If you have concerns or objections to the proposed development, you can request to speak at the hearing. This will allow you to present your case to the Committee and respond to questions.</p>

Its decisions are based on the evidence presented at the hearing and the applicable policies and regulations. While there is no guaranteed way to win an application, there are some steps you can take to increase your chances of success:</p>

                                      <p>In conclusion, the Committee of Adjustment process can be complex and time-consuming, and it is important for property owners to seek professional advice from qualified experts such as architects or planners. Having an architect involved in the process can be particularly valuable, as they can help to ensure that the proposed development meets the necessary requirements of the Zoning By-law and the Official Plan, and can prepare a strong case to present to the Committee of Adjustment. An architect can also help to address any concerns or objections from the community and provide valuable insights into the design and functionality of the proposed development. Overall, the Committee of Adjustment plays a critical role in the development process in Toronto, and having an experienced architect on board can help property owners to navigate the process successfully and achieve their development goals while contributing to the overall well-being and growth of the city.</p>
